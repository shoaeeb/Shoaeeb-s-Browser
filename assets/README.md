# Assets Folder

## Icon Requirements

For the best results, place an `icon.ico` file in this folder with the following specifications:

- **Format**: .ico file
- **Size**: 256x256 pixels (or multiple sizes: 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256)
- **Name**: `icon.ico`

## Creating an Icon

You can:
1. Use an online ICO converter to convert a PNG/JPG to ICO format
2. Use tools like GIMP, Photoshop, or online tools
3. For now, the build will work without an icon (it will use the default Electron icon)

## Temporary Solution

If you don't have an icon ready, the build process will still work - it will just use the default Electron icon.
